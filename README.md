# tiptap-menu-bubble

This project contains an example of how to implement text highlighting functionality with the tiptap library. Tiptap is a renderless editor framework to build rich-text editors with. This example shows a menu bubble that shows up above selected text in the editor and has a custom extension that facilitates text highlighting.
